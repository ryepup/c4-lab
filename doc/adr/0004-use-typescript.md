# 4. Use typescript

Date: May 2017

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I want to play with typescript, and am having trouble passing objects around and
remembering what are the valid keys in those objects.

## Decision

Use typescript for the non-angularjs bits.

## Consequences

* will have to fight libraries that don't have type definitions
* will have to fight webpack
